# Prisma Ecommerce

This repo shows an example of how to use Prisma in a TypeScript-based Node
project. It goes along with my course on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io),
"Build an API with Prisma an Express".

## Installation

Clone the repo and install the dependencies.

```bash
# with npm
npm i

# with yarn
yarn
```

## Run the API

This project uses **ts-node-dev** to watch for updates and make them immediately
available.

```bash
npm run dev
```

The API will be served at `http://localhost:3001`.
